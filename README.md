# Home-Assistant integation for Homey

This application allows you to add your home-assistant (http://home-assistant.io) devices to your Homey.

## Requirements
- Home-assistant
- Homey :)

## The list of currently support types:
- sensors, binary sensors
- switches
- light
- scenes
- scripts
- media player

## Getting started
To connect the application to your home-assistant instance you will need to create a `Long Lived Access Token` in home-assistant. You can create a token on your home-assistant account profile page (https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/authentication/).

You will also need to know the ip-address/hostname of your home-assistant instance.

Install the application on your Homey.
Then start the pairing of a new device. The first time you will be asked for the login information.
Fill in the correct address (e.g. http://127.0.0.1:8123) and the access token you have created inside home-assistant and go on in paiting process.
Now you can add the devices you want to use within Homey

## Flow action
Besides the ability to add devices and use them in your Homey flows there is also a flow action available to directly call home-assistant services inside flows.

## Compounds
Because Homey and home-assistant are modeled differently when it comes to devices it makes sense to group multiple sensors from home-assistant into one Homey device.

To do so you will have to install a custom component in your home-assistant installation:
https://github.com/RonnyWinkler/io.home-assistant.community/tree/main/custom_components/homey

After adding the custom component you can now declare the homey platform in your home-assistant configuration and define your devices.

Example:
```yaml
homey:
  livingroom_sensor:
    name: Livingroom environment
    icon: alarm_motion
    capabilities:
      measure_temperature: sensor.livingroom_temperature
      measure_humidity: sensor.livingroom_humidity
      measure_luminance: sensor.livingroom_luminance
      alarm_motion: binary_sensor.livingroom_motion
      alarm_contact: binary_sensor.toilet_door
      button: script.test
      onoff: switch.ventilation
      dim: input_number.test_slider
    capabilitiesConverters:
      measure_temperature: 
        from: (state) => { return parseFloat(state) * 2; }
        to: (value) => { return value / 2; }
      dim: 
        from: (state) => { return parseFloat(state) * 0.01; }
to: (value) => { return value * 100; }
```

After reloading your home-assistant configuration you can add it in Homey by selecting `Compound` in the `Choose a device` dialog.

Thanks for showing the way :)
